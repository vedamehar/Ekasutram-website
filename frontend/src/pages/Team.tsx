          <p>
            Ekasutram's team is organized into specialized roles, each contributing uniquely
            to the club's mission of promoting mathematical thinking and problem-solving excellence.
            From planning and coordination to technical execution and creative branding, our team
            members work collaboratively to create an engaging and impactful mathematical community.
          </p>
          <p>
            Together, we bring diverse skills and perspectives to foster an environment where
            curiosity meets challenge, and where students can explore mathematics beyond traditional
            boundaries through structured learning and hands-on experiences.
